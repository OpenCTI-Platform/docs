    [Please read the dedicated page to have all information](../enterprise.md)

As explained in the [overview page](overview.md), all administration actions are listened by default. 
However, all knowledge are not listened by default due to performance impact on the platform. 

For this reason you need to explicitly activate extended listening on user / group or organization.

Listening will start just after the configuration. Every past events will not be taken into account.
