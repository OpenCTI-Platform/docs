## Organization administration

Platform administrators can promote members of an organization as "Organization administrator". This elevated role grants them the necessary capabilities to create, edit and delete users from the corresponding Organization. Additionally, administrators have the flexibility to define a list of groups that can be granted to newly created members by the organization administrators. This feature simplifies the process of granting appropriate access and privileges to individuals joining the organization.
