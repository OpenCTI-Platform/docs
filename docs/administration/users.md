# Users and Role Based Access Control

## Introduction

In OpenCTI, the RBAC system not only related to what users can do or cannot do in the platform (aka. `Capabilities`) but also to the system of [data segregation](segregation.md). Also, platform behavior such as default home dashboards, default triggers and digests as well as default hidden menus or entities can be defined across groups and organizations.

## Roles 

Roles are used in the platform to grant the given groups with some **capabilities** to define what users in those groups can do or cannot do.

### Manage roles

You can manage the roles in `Settings > Security > Roles`.

To create a role, just click on the `+` button:

![Create role](assets/create-role.png)

Then you will be able to define the capabilities of the role:

![Update role](assets/update-role.png)

## Users

You can manage the users in `Settings > Security > Users`. If you are using [Single-Sign-On (SSO)](../deployment/authentication.md), the users in OpenCTI are automatically created upon login.

To create a user, just click on the `+` button:

![Create user](assets/create-user-new.png)

### Manage a user

When access to a user, it is possible to:

* Visualize information including the token
* Modify it, reset 2FA if necessary
* Manage its sessions
* Manage its triggers and digests
* Visualize the history and operations
* Manage its max confidence levels

![User overview](assets/user-overveiw-new.png)

From this view you can edit the user's information by clicking the "Update" button, which opens a panel with several tabs.

* Overview tab: edit all basic information such as the name or language
* Password tab: change the password for this user
* Groups tab: select the groups this user belongs to
* Organization Admin tab: see [Organization administration](users.md#organization-administration)
* Confidences tab: manage the user's maximum confidence level and overrides per entity type

![manage user](assets/user-manage.png)

!!! warning "Mandatory max confidence level"

    A user without Max confidence level won't have the ability to create, delete or update any data in our platform. Please be sure that your users are always either assigned to group that have a confidence level defined or that have an override of this group confidence level.

## Groups

Groups are the main way to manage permissions and [data segregation](segregation.md) as well as platform customization for the given users part of this group. You can manage the groups in `Settings > Security > Groups`.

Here is the description of the group available parameters.

| `Allowed markings`       | Grant access to the group to the defined marking definitions, more details in [data segregation](segregation.md).                                                         |
| `Max shareable markings` | Grant authorization to the group to share marking definitions.                                                                                                            |

![Group overview](assets/group-overview-new.png)

!!! information "Max confidence level when a user has multiple groups"
 
    A user with multiple groups will have the **the highest confidence level** of all its groups. 
    For instance, if a user is part of group A (max confidence level = 100) and group B (max confidence level = 50), then the user max confidence level will be 100.

### Manage a group

When managing a group, you can define the members and all above configurations.

## Organizations

Users can belong to organizations, which is an additional layer of [data segregation](segregation.md) and customization. To find out more about this part, please refer to the page on [organization segregation](organization-segregation.md).

## Organization administration

Platform administrators can promote members of an organization as "Organization administrator". This elevated role grants them the necessary capabilities to create, edit and delete users from the corresponding Organization. Additionally, administrators have the flexibility to define a list of groups that can be granted to newly created members by the organization administrators. This feature simplifies the process of granting appropriate access and privileges to individuals joining the organization.

![Organization admin Settings view](assets/organization_admin_view.png)

The platform administrator can promote/demote an organization admin through its user edition form.

![Organization admin promoting/demoting](assets/define_organization_admin.png)

!!! info "Organization admin rights"

    The "Organization admin" has restricted access to Settings. They can only manage the members of the organizations for which they have been promoted as "admins".
