### Organizations management and segregation

Organizations segregation is a way to segregate your data considering the organization associated to the users.

Please read [Organizations RBAC](../administration/organization-segregation.md) to get more information.

### Full text indexing

Please read [File indexing](../administration/file-indexing.md) to get all information.

### Fintel templates

Finished intelligence templates are models that can be used in containers to generate reports. Those reports can contain texts and visualizations and can be exported in pdf. Fintel templates can be created and managed in the Customization section (please read  [Fintel templates customization](./entities.md)).
