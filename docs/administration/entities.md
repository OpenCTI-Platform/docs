# Customize entities

## Introduction

The following chapter aims at giving the reader an understanding of possible options by entity type.

## Hidden in interface

This configuration hides a specific entity type across the entire platform.

An overview is available in Parameters > Hidden entity types.

## Automatic references at file upload

This configuration enables an entity to automatically construct an external reference from the uploaded file.

## Enforce references

This configuration enables the requirement of a reference message on an entity creation or modification.

## Workflow

OpenCTI have a simple workflow approach.

The available status for an entity is first defined by a collection of status templates.

Then, this status template can be used and ordered in a specific order.

## Attributes

Each attribute offers some customization options :
- Become mandatory if not already defined as such in the stix standard
- Have a default value to facilitate the creation of an entity via the creation forms
- Define the different thresholds and corresponding label for scalable attribute
