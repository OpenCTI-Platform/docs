# Taxonomy

In OpenCTI, taxonomies serve as structured classification systems that aid in organizing and categorizing intelligence data. This reference guide provides an exhaustive description of the platform's customizable fields within the taxonomies' framework. Users can modify, add, or delete values within the available vocabularies to tailor the classification system to their specific requirements.

For broader documentation on the taxonomies section, please consult [the appropriate page](../administration/ontologies.md).

## Vocabularies

Default values are based on those defined in the [STIX standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_izngjy1g98l2) but can be tailored to better suit the organization's needs.

## Customization

Users can customize the taxonomies by modifying the available values or adding new ones. These modifications enable users to adapt the classification system to their specific intelligence requirements. Additionally, within each vocabulary list, users have the flexibility to customize the order of the dropdown menu associated with the taxonomy. This feature allows users to prioritize certain values or arrange them in a manner that aligns with their specific classification needs. Additionally, users can track the usage count for each vocabulary, providing insights into the frequency of usage and helping to identify the most relevant and impactful classifications. These customization options empower users to tailor the taxonomy system to their unique intelligence requirements, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of intelligence analysis within the OpenCTI platform.
