# Automated import

Automated imports in OpenCTI streamline the process of data ingestion, allowing users to effortlessly bring in valuable intelligence from diverse sources. This page focuses on the automated methods of importing data, which serve as bridges between OpenCTI and diverse external systems, formatting it into a STIX bundle, and importing it into the OpenCTI platform.


## Connectors

Connectors in OpenCTI serve as dynamic gateways, facilitating the import of data from a wide array of sources and systems. Every connector is designed to handle specific data types and structures of the source, allowing OpenCTI to efficiently ingest the data.

### Connector behaviors

The behavior of each connector is defined by its development, determining the types of data it imports and its configuration options. This flexibility allows users to customize the import process to their specific needs, ensuring a seamless and personalized data integration experience.

The level of configuration granularity regarding the imported data type varies with each connector. Nevertheless, connectors empower users to specify the date from which they wish to fetch data. This capability is particularly useful during the initial activation of a connector, enabling the retrieval of historical data. Following this, the connector operates in real-time, continuously importing new data from the source.

### Connector Ecosystem

OpenCTI's connector ecosystem covers a broad spectrum of sources, enhancing the platform's capability to integrate data from various contexts, from threat intelligence providers to specialized databases. The list of available connectors can be found in our [connectors catalog](https://www.notion.site/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76). Connectors are categorized into three types: import connectors (the focus here), [enrichment connectors](enrichment.md), and stream consumers. Further documentation on connectors is available on [the dedicated documentation page](../deployment/connectors.md).

In summary, automated imports through connectors empower OpenCTI users with a scalable, efficient, and customizable mechanism for data ingestion, ensuring that the platform remains enriched with the latest and most relevant intelligence.


## Native automated import

In OpenCTI, the "Data > Ingestion" section provides users with built-in functions for automated data import. These functions are designed for specific purposes and can be configured to seamlessly ingest data into the platform. Here, we'll explore the configuration process for the three built-in functions: Live Streams, TAXII Feeds, and RSS Feeds.

### Live streams

Live Streams enable users to consume data from another OpenCTI platform, fostering collaborative intelligence sharing. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure Live streams synchroniser:

1. Remote OpenCTI URL: Provide the URL of the remote OpenCTI platform (e.g., `https://[domain]`; don't include the path).
2. Remote OpenCTI token: Provide the user token. An administrator from the remote platform must supply this token, and the associated user must have the "Access data sharing" privilege.
3. After filling in the URL and user token, validate the configuration.
4. Once validated, select a live stream to which you have access.

Additional configuration options:

- User responsible for data creation: Define the user responsible for creating data received from this stream. Best practice is to dedicate one user per source for organizational clarity. Please [see here](../deployment/connectors.md#connector-token-section) for more information on this good practice.
- Starting synchronization: Specify the date of the oldest data to retrieve. Leave the field empty to import everything.
- Take deletions into account: Enable this option to delete data from your platform if it was deleted on the providing stream. (Note: Data won't be deleted if another source has imported it previously.)
- Verify SSL certificate: Check the validity of the certificate of the domain hosting the remote platform.
- Avoid dependencies resolution: Import only entities without their relationships. For instance, if the stream shares malware, all the malware's relationships will be retrieved by default. This option enables you to choose not to recover them.
- Use perfect synchronization: This option is specifically for synchronizing two platforms. If an imported entity already exists on the platform, the one from the stream will overwrite it.

### TAXII feeds

TAXII Feeds in OpenCTI provide a robust mechanism for ingesting TAXII collections from TAXII servers or other OpenCTI instances. Configuring TAXII ingester involves specifying essential details to seamlessly integrate threat intelligence data. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure TAXII ingesters:

1. TAXII server URL: Provide the root API URL of the TAXII server. For collections from another OpenCTI instance, the URL is in the form `https://[domain]/taxii2/root`.
2. TAXII collection: Enter the ID of the TAXII collection to be ingested. For collections from another OpenCTI instance, the ID follows the format `426e3acb-db50-4118-be7e-648fab67c16c`.
3. Authentication type (if necessary): Enter the authentication type. For non-public collections from another OpenCTI instance, the authentication type is "Bearer token." Enter the token of a user with access to the collection (similar to the point 2 of the Live streams configuration above).

Additional configuration options:

- User responsible for data creation: Define the user responsible for creating data received from this TAXII feed. Best practice is to dedicate one user per source for organizational clarity. Please [see here](../deployment/connectors.md#connector-token-section) for more information on this good practice.
- Import from date: Specify the date of the oldest data to retrieve. Leave the field empty to import everything.

### RSS feeds

RSS Feeds functionality enables users to seamlessly ingest items in report form from specified RSS feeds. Configuring RSS Feeds involves providing essential details and selecting preferences to tailor the import process. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure RSS ingesters:

1. RSS Feed URL: Provide the URL of the RSS feed from which items will be imported.

Additional configuration options:

- User responsible for data creation: Define the user responsible for creating data received from this RSS feed. Best practice is to dedicate one user per source for organizational clarity. Please [see here](../deployment/connectors.md#connector-token-section) for more information on this good practice.
- Import from date: Specify the date of the oldest data to retrieve. Leave the field empty to import everything.
- Default report types: Indicate the report type to be applied to the imported report.
- Default author: Indicate the default author to be applied to the imported report.
- Default marking definitions: Indicate the default markings to be applied to the imported reports.
