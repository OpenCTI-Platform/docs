# Containers

## STIX standard

### Definition

In the [STIX 2.1 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/stix-v2.1.html), some STIX Domain Objects (SDO) can be considered as "container of knowledge", using the `object_refs` attribute to refer multiple other objects as nested references. In `object_refs`, it is possible to refer to entities and relationships. 

### Example

```json
{
   "type": "report",
   "spec_version": "2.1",
   "id": "report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3",
   "created_by_ref": "identity--a463ffb3-1bd9-4d94-b02d-74e4f1658283",
   "created": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
   "modified": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
   "name": "The Black Vine Cyberespionage Group",
   "description": "A simple report with an indicator and campaign",
   "published": "2016-01-20T17:00:00.000Z",
   "report_types": ["campaign"],
   "object_refs": [
      "indicator--26ffb872-1dd9-446e-b6f5-d58527e5b5d2",
      "campaign--83422c77-904c-4dc1-aff5-5c38f3a2c55c",
      "relationship--f82356ae-fe6c-437c-9c24-6b64314ae68a"
   ]
}
```

In the previous example, we have a nested reference to 3 other objects:

```json
"object_refs": [
   "indicator--26ffb872-1dd9-446e-b6f5-d58527e5b5d2",
   "campaign--83422c77-904c-4dc1-aff5-5c38f3a2c55c",
   "relationship--f82356ae-fe6c-437c-9c24-6b64314ae68a"
]
```

## Implementation

### Types of container

In OpenCTI, containers are displayed differently than other entities, because they contain pieces of knowledge. Here is the list of containers in the platform:

| Type of entity     | STIX standard    | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Report             | Native           | Reports are collections of threat intelligence focused on one or more topics, such as a description of a threat actor, malware, or attack technique, including context and related details. |
| Grouping           | Native           | A Grouping object explicitly asserts that the referenced STIX Objects have a shared context, unlike a STIX Bundle (which explicitly conveys no context).     |
| Observed Data      | Native           | Observed Data conveys information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). |
| Note               | Native           | A Note is intended to convey informative text to provide further context and/or to provide additional analysis not contained in the STIX Objects.            |
| Opinion            | Native           | An Opinion is an assessment of the correctness of the information in a STIX Object produced by a different entity.                                           |
| Case               | Extension        | A case whether an Incident Response, a Request for Information or a Request for Takedown is use to convey an epic with a set of tasks.                       |
| Task               | Extension        | A task, generally used in the context of case, is intended to convery information about something that must be done in a limited timeframe.                  |

### Containers behaviour

In the platform, it is always possible to visualize the list of entities and/or observables referenced in a container (`Container > Entities or Observables`) but also to add / remove entities from the container.

![Entities](assets/entities.png)

As containers can also contain relationships, which are generally linked to the other entities in the container, it is also possible to visualize the container as a graph (`Container > Knowledge`)

### Containers of an entity or a relationship

On the entity or the relationship side, you can always find all containers where the objecti is contained using the top menu `Analysis`:

In all containers list, you can also filter containers based on one or multiple contained object(s):
