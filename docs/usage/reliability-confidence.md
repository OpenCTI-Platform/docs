# Reliability and confidence

## Reliability

We can set a reliability value for Organizations, Individuals, Systems and Reports.
For all entities, along with confidence, we display the reliability of source, based on the reliability of the entity's author (organization, individual or system).

You can also filter entities by reliability of author.
