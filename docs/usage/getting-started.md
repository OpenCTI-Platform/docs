# Getting started

This guide aims to give you a full overview of the OpenCTI features and workflows. The platform can be used in various contexts to handle threats management use cases from a technical to a more strategic level. OpenCTI has been designed as a knowledge graph, taking inputs (threat intelligence feeds, sightings & alerts, vulnerabilities, assets, artifacts, etc.) and generating outputs based on built-in capabilities and / or connectors.

Here are some examples of use cases:

* Cyber Threat Intelligence knowledge base
* Detection as code feeds for XDR, EDR, SIEMs, firewalls, proxies, etc.
* Incident response artifacts & cases management
* Vulnerabilities management
* Reporting, alerting and dashboarding on a subset of data

## Welcome dashboard

The welcome gives any visitor on the OpenCTI platform an outlook on the live of the platform. It can be replaced by a [custom dashboard](dashboards.md), created by a user (or the default dashboard in a role, a group or an organization).
