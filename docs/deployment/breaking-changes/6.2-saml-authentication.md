# Change to SAML authentication default parameters

!!! info ""

    * **Changed in**: `OpenCTI 6.2`

## Description of changes

Upgrading `passport-saml` library introduced a breaking change with respect to the default SAML parameters regarding signing responses and assertions.

When `want_assertions_signed` and `want_authn_response_signed` SAML parameter are not present in OpenCTI configuration,
the default is now set to `true` by `passport-saml` library when previously it was `false` by default.

## Migrate guide

If you have issues after upgrade, you can try with both parameters set to `false`.
