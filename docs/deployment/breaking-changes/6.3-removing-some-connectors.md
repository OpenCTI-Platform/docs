!!! info ""

    * **Deprecated in**: `OpenCTI 6.3`
    * **Removed in**: `OpenCTI 6.6`

## Description of changes

Some bi-directional stream connectors have been divided into two distinct connectors:

- An **external import connector** that gathers information from external organizations, applications, or services into OpenCTI.
- A **stream connector** that transfers OpenCTI data to third-party platforms.

The existing connectors affected by this change will be removed and replaced with these two new connectors.

The connectors concerned are:
- **Tanium stream connector**
  - Removed: tanium
  - Replaced by:
    - tanium-incidents external import connector
    - tanium-intel stream connector
- **Harfang Lab stream connector**

  - Replaced by:
    - harfang-lab-incidents external import connector
    - harfang-lab-intel stream connector
- **Microsoft Sentinel stream connector**
  - Removed: sentinel
  - Replaced by:
    - sentinel-incidents external import connector
    - sentinel-intel stream connector
