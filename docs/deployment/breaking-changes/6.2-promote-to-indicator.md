# Change to the observable "promote" API

!!! info ""

    * **Deprecated in**: `OpenCTI 6.2`
    * **Removed in**: `OpenCTI 6.5`

## Description of changes

The API calls that promote an Observable to Indicator now return the created Indicator instead of the original Observable.

**GraphQL API**

* Mutation `StixCyberObservableEditMutations.promote` is now deprecated
* New Mutation `StixCyberObservableEditMutations.promoteToIndicator` introduced


**Client-Python API**

* Client-python method `client.stix_cyber_observable.promote_to_indicator` is now deprecated
* New Client-python method `client.stix_cyber_observable.promote_to_indicator_v2` introduced


## Migration guide

If you are using custom scripts that make use of the deprecated API methods, please update these scripts.

The changes are straightforward: if you are using the return value of the method, you should now expect the new Indicator
instead of the Observable being promoted; adapt your code accordingly.
